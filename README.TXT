THIS FILE CONTAINS A QUICK BOOTSTRAP TO RUN SAMPLE CODE AGAINST
 FLEXICIOUS HTMLTREEGRID
 FLEXICIOUS REACTDATAGRID

 HTMLTREEGRID IS A PURE JAVASCRIPT DATAGRID COMPONENT
 REACTDATAGRID IS A PURE REACT DATAGRID COMPONENT

 IN THE LIBS FOLDER, ARE 2 JS FILES 

 HTMLTREEGRID.JS CONTAINS
    1) HTMLTREEGRID LIBRARY [USUALLY MINIFIED-COMPILED-JQUERY.JS]
    2) JQUERY, JQUERYUI, AND THE WATERMARK, TOASTER, MASKED INPUT, AND THE THEMES.JS THAT SHIPS WITH THE BUILD
    3) BABEL-CORE AND BROWSER POLYFILL FOR IE: [TO TRANSPILE ES6 INTO ES5 AT RUNTIME]
        https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.6.15/browser-polyfill.min.js
        https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.8.34/browser.min.js        
 REACTDATAGRID.JS
    1) THE REACT-DATAGRID LIBRARY [USUALLY REACT-DATAGRID-MIN.JS]
    2) THE STYLES ADDON [REACT-DATAGRID-STYLES.JS ] BUILT FROM https://github.com/flexicious/react-datagrid-styles 
    3) BABEL-CORE AND BROWSER POLYFILL FOR IE:: [TO TRANSPILE ES6 INTO ES5 AT RUNTIME]
        https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.6.15/browser-polyfill.min.js
        https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.8.34/browser.min.js        
    4) REACT and REACT DOM

THE IDEA IS TO GET YOU UP AND RUNNING WITH THE EXAMPLES QUICKLY. THIS IS NOT A PRODUCTION SETUP. IN PRODUCTION YOU WOULD
PRECOMPILE YOUR ES6 TO ES5 USING BABEL FOR WEBPACK OR SOMETHING SIMILAR.
